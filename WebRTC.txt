< WebRTC >

- WebRTC, short for Web Real-Time Communication, is both an API and a Protocol.
- The WebRTC protocol is a set of rules for two WebRTC agents to negotiate bi-directional secure real-time communication.
- The WebRTC API then allows developers to use the WebRTC protocol.

- WebRTC Protocol's sequential four big steps
  Signaling
  Connecting
  Securing
  Communicating


- new RTCPeerConnection : the top-level “WebRTC Session”. It contains all the protocols.

- addTrack
  it creates a new RTP stream.
  A random Synchronization Source (SSRC) will be generated for this stream.
  This stream will then be inside the SDP
  Each call to addTrack will create a new SSRC and media section.
  Immediately after an SRTP Session is established, these media packets will start being encrypted using SRTP and sent via ICE.


- createDataChannel 
  it creates a new SCTP stream if no SCTP association exists.
  Immediately after a DTLS Session is established, the SCTP association will start sending packets encrypted with DTLS via ICE.

- createOffer
  it generates a SDP of local state
